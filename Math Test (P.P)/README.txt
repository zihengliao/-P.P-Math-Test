Status: runnable, ongoing process to add more complex questions


Program process:
- Ask for user input for the number of questions and difficulty 
- Depending on the input, prompt user for answers to math questions of type:
    - Addition and subtraction of integers 
    - Multiplication of integers 
    - Division with integer results 
- Print result along with useful statistics and feedback (if any answers were wrong)


To be added:
[ ] Decimal stuff MULTIPLICATION (single whole number 1-9, one digit, one decimal place)* (single whole number 1- 9, one digit, one integer two decimal places)**
ADDITION/SUBTRACTION (two one integer, one digit deicmla places) (two, two digit integer and decimal places) (two, two integer, three deicmal palces)
DIVISON (always give answer of multiple of 0.5, one digit divisor) (always give answer  of multiple of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) (always give answer of multple 0.1, two digit and one digit)

[ ] Fraction stuff (fractional adding)
[ ] Interface (tkinter)


Known issues:
- When accepting input answers, does not catch error of when its not a number - assuming we would need try except statements but the body would be too long (read elsewhere that you should keep try statemnts as small as possible)
